# Flow Around Formula Car Of OzU Racing Team
As part of the ME396: Computational Fluid Dynamics with Professional Simulation Tools course, we conducted a detailed CFD study on two different carbon fiber body geometries of the OzU Racing Team’s 2025 Formula Student car using Siemens Star CCM+
The project involved simplified CAD modeling, meshing, and steady-state flow simulations at 25 m/s to compare aerodynamic drag forces.
Two iterations were carried out: Iteration 1 used basic boundary conditions, while Iteration 2 included moving ground and rotating tires for enhanced realism.
In Iteration 1, Body 2 showed approximately 18% less drag than Body 1. However, after refining the simulation setup in Iteration 2, Body 1 resulted in approximately 4.7% less drag than Body 2.
Our results revealed the difference in drag performance between the designs, offering valuable insights for future aerodynamic optimizations and designs.
