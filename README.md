# Flow Around Formula Car Of Racing Team

This repository documents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of two carbon fiber body geometries designed for the OzU Racing Teamâ€™s 2025 Formula Student car.

The project was conducted as part of the ME396: Computational Fluid Dynamics with Professional Simulation Tools course at Ã–zyeÄŸin University.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To evaluate and compare the aerodynamic performance (drag force) of two simplified Formula Student body designs using Siemens STAR-CCM+. Rotating tires and a moving ground setup were used for more realistic simulation.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **CAD base:** Shifu25 car (SolidWorks) â€“ simplified for CFD.
- **Meshing:** Trimmed cell mesh with prism layers, symmetry applied.
- **Simulation:** Steady-state, RANS equations with SST K-Omega turbulence model.
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - Velocity inlet: 25 m/s
  - Tire rotation modeled
  - Moving ground in iteration 2

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Setup

All simulations were steady-state with symmetry applied. The tire rotation and airflow were configured to represent realistic racing conditions.
